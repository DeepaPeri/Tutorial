# R Programming for Data Science

## History and Overview of R

###  Basic Features of R

1) R syntax is very similar to S, easy for S-PLUS to switch over


2) R is technically much similar to Scheme language
3) R is open source
4) R has frequent releases
5) R has statistical packages also has sophisticated graphic capabilities

### Advantages of R

1) R is the most comprehensive statistical analysis package as new technology and ideas often appear first in R.
2) Being open source anyone can make contributions like bug fixes, code enhancements and add new packages.
3) R is good for GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows. R is cross-platform which runs on many operating systems.

### Limitations of R 

1) In R commands give less thought to memory. So R consumes most of the memory.
2) It is an old technology
3) Doesn't support advanced graphic packages
4) It is being developed by multiple users so R development depends on cosumers and developers interest


### Design of R system

Primary R system is available from  [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/)

CRAN also hosts many add-on packages to extend the functionality of R.


#### R system is divided into 2 conceptual parts: 

1) Base R system downloaded from CRAN 
2) Other than CRAN

#### R functionality is divided into number of packages:

1) The "**base**" R system contains "base" R package which runs R and also consists of basic functionalities
2) Other packages in "base" R system : 

    1) utils

    2) stats

    3) data sets

    4) graphics

    5) grDevices

    6) grid

    7) method

    8) tools

    9) parallel

    10) compiler

    11) splines

    12) tcltk

    13) stats4

3) There are also "**Recommended**" packages : *boot, class, cluster, codetools, foreign, kernSmooth, lattice, mgcv, nlme, rpart, survival, MASS, spatial, nnet, Matrix*

4) There are over 4000 packages in CRAN that have been developer by users and programmers around the world
